### Description

Single File Compression using splay trees an improved version I have submitted last 6 days ago.

It also teach the use of drive list box, file list box and dir list box. Further explanation are

found in the code and readme. It just illustrate a compression routine that can be embedded in your programs fast enough but with good compression ratio. Error handling is not implemented yet so be careful when compressing and

expanding files.
 
### More Info

Compress file or Expanded file

It overwrites the file name specified or selected without any prior notice. Error handling is not implemented yet. So be careful.
